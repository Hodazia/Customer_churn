## Customer Churn Prediction

### Problem Statement
In this project, we are addressing a classification problem known as customer churn prediction. Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify customers as either churners or non-churners. Churn, the loss of customers to competitors or disengagement, can have significant implications for businesses, from financial setbacks to tarnished reputation. By identifying customers who are at a higher risk of churn, companies can implement targeted retention campaigns, tailored customer care support, and enticing offers to keep them engaged and loyal.
